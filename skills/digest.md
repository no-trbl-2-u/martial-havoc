# Skill: digest

> **The night shift.** One tick a day: take the loop's pulse,
> write the morning briefing to `plan/DIGEST.md`, run the
> breadth checks too slow for the per-commit path, propose
> gate tunings as candidates — never apply them. The

## 1. Purpose

The dispatcher's ticks are visible one at a time; nobody
reads twenty run logs. This verb compresses a day of loop
activity — shipped ticks, no-ops, crashes — into one
committed, phone-readable file, and owns the O(everything)
work that must never run per-commit.

## 2. Invocation

```
/digest                      # the full nightly pass
```

Runs from `.github/workflows/night.yml` (daily) or by hand.
Never dispatched by `/march` — it is its own loop shape with
its own cadence.

## 3. The procedure

1. **Sync:** `git pull --ff-only`.
2. **Gather the pulse:**

   ```bash
   git log --since="26 hours ago" --oneline
   gh run list --workflow march -L 20 \
     --json displayTitle,conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt
   ```

   Plus queue states: build-plan `[ ]` / `[blocked:]` counts,
   `plan/AUDIT.md` pending, `plan/CRITIQUE.md` pending + last
   pass age, `data/BACKLOG.md` pending (if a data layer
   exists), `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` pending + oldest-pending
   age + how many `## Pending` rows carry a `- proposed:` date
   more than 21 days old (hand-count from the same rows), open
   `triage:needs-user` / `loop:do` issues, deploy state
   (`pnpm deploy:check`).
3. **Breadth checks** (the night-only legs — adapt per
   project; see `nexus/customization/hermetic-e2e.md`):

   ```bash
   SMOKE_SAMPLE=full pnpm e2e     # every URL, not the sample
   ```

   Failures become HIGH `plan/AUDIT.md` rows — the digest
   files them; the next dispatcher tick fixes them.
4. **Write `plan/DIGEST.md`** — overwrite entirely; it is a
   snapshot, not a ledger. Sections, in order: `Headline`,
   `While you were out` (pulse table: tick, verb, outcome —
   no-ops included), `Shipped`, `Queues now` (the candidates
   line grows the >21-day count alongside the existing
   pending-count and oldest-age numbers, e.g. "9 pending (3
   >21d), oldest 30d"), `Needs you` (blocked rows, needs-user
   issues, `[needs-user-call]`s, plus — when either ≥5
   candidates are pending >21 days or the oldest pending
   candidate exceeds 45 days — a line reading "oversight
   needed: candidate queue silting (N pending >21d, oldest
   Xd)"), `Today's intent` (next `[ ]` phase + top finding),
   `Tuning proposals` (step 5, or "none").
5. **Meta-loop, within rails:** if the pulse shows a mistuned
   gate (critique never firing, the ceiling hibernating
   productive days, a starved queue), file the tuning as a
   `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` candidate citing the pulse
   numbers. **Never edit gates, cadences, ceilings, or rules
   directly** — proposals only; `/oversight` promotes. The
   loop does not vote on its own constraints.
6. **Gate + commit + push:** `pnpm verify`, then one commit
   `digest: <YYYY-MM-DD>` and push. Cloud ticks confirm the
   deploy per the standing rules if the digest commit
   triggers one.

## 4. Hard rules

1. Overwrite `plan/DIGEST.md` whole; history lives in git.
2. Ship nothing else — breadth failures become findings, not
   fixes. The night shift briefs; the dispatcher ships.
3. Proposals, never actions (the meta-loop rail).
4. A quiet day still gets a digest — "quiet" is information.
5. One commit; cloud ticks carry the `Cloud-Run:` trailer.
6. No `Co-Authored-By`, no emojis, no `--no-verify` — the
   standing rules apply at 3am too.

## 5. Failure modes

1. **`gh` unavailable** — degrade to a git-only pulse; note
   the degradation in the digest itself.
2. **Breadth check red** — that's a finding (HIGH AUDIT row),
   not a stop; the digest ships with the finding filed.
3. **Verify gate red on the digest commit itself** — fix only
   what the digest broke; ≤3 iterations, then stop loud per
   the standing rules.
4. **`git pull` divergence** — stop.

## 6. Quick reference

```bash
plan/DIGEST.md                       # the deliverable (overwrite)
plan/AUDIT.md                        # breadth failures land here
plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md             # tuning proposals land here
gh run list --workflow march -L 20   # the invisible no-ops
SMOKE_SAMPLE=full pnpm e2e           # the nightly breadth leg
pnpm verify
git commit -m "digest: <YYYY-MM-DD>" && git push origin main
```
